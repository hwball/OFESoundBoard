# OFESoundBoard

Custom soundboard using naudio and vb audio cable.

The sound files base path will need to be changed 
to the local path and the waveOutEvent driver number 
can be commented out if you are not using a custom 
driver (VB-Audio Cable)

Playing mp3 from url is supported however it is in an 
unstable state
